title: A way to calibrate a magnetometer
---

My first contact with a digital magnetometer dates back to the summer of 2009.
At that time, as many *arduinoers*, I was more concerned about coding the
I2C/SPI driver other than understanding the device itself. A few months later I
got an iPhone 4 and realized that the compass application, which used the
internal phone magnetometer, required calibration every time it had to be used.
And so, I became interested on why was this step required and how can it be
done. In this post I will try to explain, together with a practical example, a
way to do it. It is in essence the method described
[here](https://sites.google.com/site/sailboatinstruments1/), but with some more
details and references.

# Preliminary concepts

Before we start it is important to have a few concepts clear. It seems logical
that we need to have a basic understanding of the Earth magnetic field, as it is
what we want to measure. Furthermore, basic knowledge of quadrics (e.g. spheres
or ellipsoids) will turn out to be important. It may seem awkward to talk about
quadrics here, but it will quickly make sense.

## The Earth magnetic field

At any location on Earth, the magnetic field can be locally represented as a
constant three dimensional vector ($$\mathbf{h}_0$$). This vector can be
characterized by three properties. Firstly, the intensity or magnitude
($$\mathcal{F}$$), normally measured in nanoteslas (nT) with an approximate
range of 25000 nT to 65000 nT. Secondly, the inclination ($$\mathcal{I}$$), with
negative values (up to -90&deg;) if pointing up and positive (up to 90&deg;) if
pointing down. Thirdly, the declination ($$\mathcal{D}$$) which measures the
deviation of the field relative to the geographical north and is positive
eastward.

  <figcaption>Magnetic field frame of reference. Source: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3AXYZ-DIS_magnetic_field_coordinates.svg">Wikimedia Commons</a></figcaption>
</figure>

Using the frame of reference in the figure shown above, the Earth magnetic field
vector $$\mathbf{h}_0$$ can be written as:

$$
\mathbf{h}_0 = \mathcal{F}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \cos{(\mathcal{I})} \cos{(\mathcal{D})} \\
        \cos{(\mathcal{I})} \sin{(\mathcal{D})} \\
        \sin{(\mathcal{I})}
    \end{bmatrix}.
\label{eq_h0}
\tag{1}
$$

Given a geographical point the [WMM
model](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/WMM/DoDWMM.shtml) can be used to obtain
the expected values for $$\mathcal{F}$$, $$\mathcal{I}$$ and $$\mathcal{D}$$.
The magnetic declination is specially useful in order to calculate the
geographical north in a compass.

## Quadrics

Quadrics are all surfaces that can be expressed as a second degree polynomial in
$$x$$, $$y$$ and $$z$$. They include popular surfaces such as spheres,
ellipsoids, paraboloids, etc. The general implicit equation of a quadric surface
$$\mathit{S}$$ is given by:

$$
\begin{align}
\mathit{S} :~ & ax^2 + by^2 + cz^2 + \\
              & 2fxy + 2gxz + 2hyz + \\
	      & 2px + 2qy + 2rz + d = 0.
\end{align}
\label{eq_quad_gen}
\tag{2}
$$

Eq. $$\eqref{eq_quad_gen}$$ can be written in a semi-matricial form, which will
be particularly useful for our problem:

$$
\mathit{S}: \mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{M} \mathbf{x} + 2\mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{n} + d = 0
\label{eq_quad_semat}
\tag{3}
$$

where $$\mathbf{x}$$ is:

$$
\mathbf{x} =
\begin{bmatrix}
    x \\
    y \\
    z
\end{bmatrix}
$$

and $$\mathbf{M}$$, $$\mathbf{n}$$ are, respectively:

$$
\mathbf{M} =
\begin{bmatrix}
    a & f & g \\
    f & b & h \\
    g & h & c
\end{bmatrix},
~~
\mathbf{n} =
\begin{bmatrix}
    p \\
    q \\
    r
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

A sphere of radius 1 centered at origin would be defined by:

$$
\mathbf{M} =
\begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 1 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix},
~~
\mathbf{n} =
\begin{bmatrix}
    0 \\
    0 \\
    0
\end{bmatrix}
~
\text{and}
~
d=-1.
$$

Eq. $$\eqref{eq_quad_gen}$$ can also be written purely in matrix form as:

$$
\mathit{S}: \mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{Q} \mathbf{x} = 0
$$

where $$\mathbf{x}$$ and $$\mathbf{Q}$$ are, respectively:

$$
\mathbf{x} =
\begin{bmatrix}
x & y & z & 1
\end{bmatrix}^T,
~~
\mathbf{Q} =
\left[
    \begin{array}{c|c}
        \mathbf{M} & \mathbf{n}\\
        \hline
        \mathbf{n}^T & d
    \end{array}
\right].
$$

The type of quadric is determined by some properties of the matrices
$$\mathbf{M}$$ and $$\mathbf{Q}$$ as detailed
[here](http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/docs/reference/CRC-formulas/node61.html).

# Measuring with a magnetometer

Initially, let's assume that we are in a magnetic disturbance free environment
and that we have an ideal 3-axis magnetometer. Under these conditions, a
magnetometer reading $$\mathbf{h}$$ taken with an arbitrary orientation will be
given by:

$$
\mathbf{h} = \mathbf{R}_x(\phi) \mathbf{R}_y(\theta) \mathbf{R}_z(\varphi)
             \mathbf{h}_0,
\label{eq_h}
\tag{4}
$$

where $$\mathbf{h}_0$$ is the local Earth magnetic field given in
$$\eqref{eq_h0}$$ and $$\mathbf{R}_x(\phi)$$, $$\mathbf{R}_y(\theta)$$,
$$\mathbf{R}_z(\varphi)$$ are [rotation
matrices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wArGifkRD2A&index=3&list=PL_w_qWAQZtAZhtzPI5pkAtcUVgmzdAP8g)
around the frame of reference $$x$$, $$y$$, $$z$$ axis, respectively.
Complementary sources of information would be needed to determine the
orientation. It is easy to see that samples locus is a sphere of radius
$$\mathcal{F}$$:

$$
\mathbf{h}^T \mathbf{h} = \ldots = \mathcal{F}^2.
\label{eq_h_const}
\tag{5}
$$

This way way of looking at the magnetometer samples gives us a geometric
perspective of the problem. A calculated example is shown in the interactive
plot found below.

## Distortion sources

In real life nothing is ideal neither the environment is disturbance free. As
detailed in this [publication](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/js/2010/967245/),
there are two main categories of measurement distortion sources: instrumentation
errors and magnetic interferences. In the next sections they will be briefly
described, concluding with the measurement model.

### Instrumentation errors

<div class="grid">
<div class="grid-col-67">
Instrumentation errors are unique and constant for each device. They can be
modeled as a result of three components. Firstly, a scale factor, which can
be modeled as a diagonal matrix:

$$
\mathbf{S} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
    s_x & 0   & 0 \\
    0   & s_y & 0 \\
    0   & 0   & s_z
    \end{bmatrix}
\label{eq_s}
\tag{6}
$$

Secondly, the non-orthogonality of the sensor axis, which can be modeled as:

$$
\mathbf{N} =
\begin{bmatrix}
    \mathbf{n}_x & \mathbf{n}_y & \mathbf{n}_z
\end{bmatrix}
\tag{7}
$$

where each column represents a vector of size 3 corresponding to each sensor
axis with respect to the sensor frame.

Finally, a sensor offset which can be simply modeled as:

$$
\mathbf{b}_{so} = \left[b_{so_x} ~ b_{so_y} ~ b_{so_z} \right]^T.
\tag{8}
$$

  </figure>
</div>
</div>

### Magnetic interferences

<div class="grid">
<div class="grid-col-67">
<p>
The magnetic interferences are caused by ferromagnetic elements present in the
surroundings of the sensor. It is composed by permanent (hard iron) and induced
magnetism (soft iron). Note that we ignore any non-constant magnetic
interference.
</p>

Hard iron results from permanent magnets and magnetic hysteresis (remanence
of magnetized iron). It is equivalent to a bias, which can be modeled as:

$$
\mathbf{b}_{hi} = \left[b_{hi_x} ~ b_{hi_y} ~ b_{hi_z} \right]^T.
\tag{9}
$$

Soft iron is due by the interaction of an external magnetic field with
ferromagnetic materials, causing a change in the intensity and direction of the
sensed field. It can be modeled as:

$$
\mathbf{A}_{si} = \begin{bmatrix}
                    a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\
                    a_{12} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\
                    a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33}
                  \end{bmatrix}
\label{eq_si}
\tag{10}
$$

interference.

## Measurement model

After detailing each distortion source, we can easily write down the measurement
model. All the distortion sources described in $$\eqref{eq_s}-\eqref{eq_si}$$
can be combined to express the measured magnetic field $$\mathbf{h}_m$$ as:

$$
\mathbf{h}_m = \mathbf{SN}(\mathbf{A}_{si}\mathbf{h} + \mathbf{b}_{hi}) +
                \mathbf{b}_{so}
\label{eq_h_meas_ns}
\tag{11}
$$

where $$\mathbf{h}$$ is the true magnetic field given by $$\eqref{eq_h}$$. It is
worth to note at this point that our measurement model does not include any
stochastic noise. This is in some way unrealistic, however, it simplifies the
solution approach at the cost of a slightly biased solution (assuming a small
amplitude noise). You may use the method described in this
[paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=6289882&tag=1) to
extend our solution by including noise.

Grouping terms $$\eqref{eq_h_meas_ns}$$ can be re-written as:

$$
\mathbf{h}_m = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{h} + \mathbf{b}
\label{eq_h_meas}
\tag{12}
$$

where:

$$
\begin{matrix}
    \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{SNA}_{si} \\
    \mathbf{b} = \mathbf{SNb}_{hi} + \mathbf{b}_{so}.
\end{matrix}
$$

$$\mathbf{A}$$ is a matrix combining scale factors, misalignments and soft-iron
effects, while $$\mathbf{b}$$ is the combined bias vector. It can be proved that
the linear transformation of $$\mathbf{h}$$ in $$\eqref{eq_h_meas}$$ makes the
measurements $$\mathbf{h}_m$$ to lie on an ellipsoid. Therefore, we will see in
the next section that the calibration process reduces to an ellipsoid fitting
problem.

# Calibration

It becomes clear from $$\eqref{eq_h_meas}$$ that we need to find an estimate
of $$\mathbf{A}$$ and $$\mathbf{b}$$, which we will note as $$\mathbf{\hat{A}}$$
and $$\mathbf{\hat{b}}$$. Then, any new measurement $$\mathbf{h}_n$$ can be simply
calibrated as:

$$
\mathbf{\hat{h}}_n = \mathbf{\hat{A}}^{-1}(\mathbf{h}_n - \mathbf{\hat{b}}).
$$

We first start expressing $$\mathbf{h}$$, using $$\eqref{eq_h_meas}$$, as:

$$
\mathbf{h} = \mathbf{A}^{-1}(\mathbf{h}_m - \mathbf{b})
$$

which combined with $$\eqref{eq_h_const}$$ leads to:

$$
\begin{align}
   & \mathbf{h}_m^T \mathbf{A}^{-T} \mathbf{A}^{-1} \mathbf{h}_m - \\
   & 2 \mathbf{h}_m^T \mathbf{A}^{-T} \mathbf{A}^{-1} \mathbf{b} + \\
   & \mathbf{b}^T \mathbf{A}^{-T} \mathbf{A}^{-1} \mathbf{b} -
     \mathcal{F}^2 = 0.
\end{align}
\label{eq_cal_quad_ns}
\tag{13}
$$

Eq. $$\eqref{eq_cal_quad_ns}$$ can be re-written in the familiar quadric form:

$$
\mathbf{h}_m^T \mathbf{M} \mathbf{h}_m + 2 \mathbf{h}_m^T \mathbf{n} + d = 0
\label{eq_cal_quad}
\tag{14}
$$

where:

$$
\mathbf{M} = \mathbf{A}^{-T} \mathbf{A}^{-1}
\label{eq_cal_M}
\tag{15a}
$$

$$
\mathbf{n} = -1 \mathbf{A}^{-T} \mathbf{A}^{-1} \mathbf{b} = -1 \mathbf{M} \mathbf{b}
\label{eq_cal_n}
\tag{15b}
$$

$$
d = \mathbf{b}^T \mathbf{A}^{-T} \mathbf{A}^{-1} \mathbf{b} - \mathcal{F}^2.
\label{eq_cal_d}
\tag{15c}
$$

As we noted in the previous section our quadric surface will be an ellipsoid.
Thus, we need to use an ellipsoid fitting algorithm which provides us with
estimates of the quadric surface parameters, $$\mathbf{\hat{M}}$$,
$$\mathbf{\hat{n}}$$ and $$\hat{d}$$. Multiple algorithms have been developed to
fit a set of points to an ellipsoid surface. We will use the LS fitting method
described in this
[paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1290055) by Q. Li
et al. This method is easy to implement and there is also a MATLAB version
readily
[available](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23377-ellipsoid-fitting).
Even though presented as an iterative method, a single step fit is enough if the
points describe well the ellipsoid (which will be our case).  Furthermore, it is
shown that it performs reasonably well for low noise levels.

Using $$\eqref{eq_cal_quad}$$ and $$\eqref{eq_cal_M}$$-$$\eqref{eq_cal_d}$$ with
the estimated values $$\mathbf{\hat{M}}$$, $$\mathbf{\hat{n}}$$ and $$\hat{d}$$
we can find $$\mathbf{\hat{A}}$$ (or $$\mathbf{\hat{A}}^{-1}$$) and
$$\mathbf{\hat{b}}$$. As detailed in this
[paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=6289882&tag=1), you
will need to find the proper scale of the solution, which is found to be:

$$
\mathbf{\hat{b}} = - \mathbf{\hat{M}}^{-1} \mathbf{\hat{n}}
\label{eq_cal_b}
\tag{16}
$$

$$
\mathbf{\hat{A}}^{-1} =
  \frac{\mathcal{F}}
    {\sqrt{\mathbf{\hat{n}}^T\mathbf{\hat{M}}^{-1}\mathbf{\hat{n}} - \hat{d}}}
  \mathbf{\hat{M}}^{\frac{1}{2}}.
\label{eq_cal_A_1}
\tag{17}
$$

As you can observe from $$\eqref{eq_cal_A_1}$$, knowledge of $$\mathcal{F}$$ is
required in order to calculate $$\mathbf{\hat{A}}^{-1}$$. This will make the
calibrated sphere to have radius $$\mathcal{F}$$. However, in many applications
such as in attitude estimation, the magnitude is irrelevant. If that is your
case, you can make it one or any other convenient value.

In order to conclude this section, the proposed code to perform the calibration
is shown below. It uses [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) and
[SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/) for numeric calculations as well as the sensor
class detailed in the next section.

# Example

To conclude this post we will use samples from a real magnetometer, which will
allow us to see if the proposed solution behaves as expected. It is important to
note that we will not evaluate the accuracy of our solution, neither other
things such as how the number of samples or their spatial distribution affects
the calibration. These are topics that would require further study, out of the
scope of this post.

The chosen magnetometer is the one found inside the [Invensense
MPU-9150](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11486): AK8975C. It is a module that
also contains an accelerometer and a gyroscope, not required for our purposes. A
Raspberry Pi 2 will be used as a host platform, as shown below. This will allow
us to quickly code a proof of concept by just using a few lines of Python. Note
that you will need to activate the I2C driver and install `python-smbus` on the
Raspberry Pi (details
[here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-4-gpio-setup/configuring-i2c)).

The proposed code for the AK8975C drive is:

{% highlight python %}
import smbus

# MPU9150 used registers
MPU9150_ADDR                       = 0x68

MPU9150_INT_PIN_CFG                = 0x37
MPU9150_INT_PIN_CFG_I2C_BYPASS_EN  = 0x02

# AK8975C used registers
AK8975C_ADDR                       = 0x0C

AK8975C_HXL                        = 0x03
AK8975C_CNTL                       = 0x0A
AK8975C_CNTL_SINGLE                = 0x01

# convert to s16 from two's complement
to_s16 = lambda n: n - 0x10000 if n > 0x7FFF else n


class SensorAK8975C(object):
    ''' AK8975C Simple Driver.

    # sensor sensitivity (uT/LSB)
    _sensitivity = 0.3

    def __init__(self, bus):
        self.bus = smbus.SMBus(bus)

        # wake up and set bypass for AK8975C
        self.bus.write_byte_data(MPU9150_ADDR, MPU9150_PWR_MGMT_1, 0)
        self.bus.write_byte_data(MPU9150_ADDR, MPU9150_INT_PIN_CFG,
                                 MPU9150_INT_PIN_CFG_I2C_BYPASS_EN)

        '''

        # request single shot
        self.bus.write_byte_data(AK8975C_ADDR, AK8975C_CNTL,
                                               AK8975C_CNTL_SINGLE)

        # wait for data ready
        r = self.bus.read_byte_data(AK8975C_ADDR, AK8975C_ST1)

        # read x, y, z
        data = self.bus.read_i2c_block_data(AK8975C_ADDR, AK8975C_HXL, 6)

        return [self._sensitivity * to_s16(data[0] | (data[1] << 8)),
                self._sensitivity * to_s16(data[2] | (data[3] << 8)),
                self._sensitivity * to_s16(data[4] | (data[5] << 8))]
{% endhighlight %}

Merging the sensor driver shown above with the code in the previous section will
allow us to both sample and calibrate. We can also append the code shown below,
which will allow us to store non-calibrated and calibrated samples to then
visualize the results with any plotting library:

{% highlight python %}
from time import sleep

def collect(fn, fs=10):
    ''' Collect magnetometer samples

        Parameters
        ----------
        fn : str
            Output file.
        fs : int (optional)
            Approximate sampling frequency (Hz), default 10 Hz.
    '''

    print('Collecting [%s]. Ctrl-C to finish' % fn)
    with open(fn, 'w') as f:
        f.write('x,y,z\n')
        try:
            while True:
                s = m.read()
                f.write('%.1f,%.1f,%.1f\n' % (s[0], s[1], s[2]))
                sleep(1./fs)
        except KeyboardInterrupt: pass

m = Magnetometer('ak8975c', 1, 46.85)
collect('ncal.csv')
m.calibrate()
collect('cal.csv')
{% endhighlight %}

Real results are displayed in the following interactive plot:
